Krypton is a library that implements the cryptographic primitives like ciphers or hash functions into Kotlin Multiplatform. Below this text you can see a list of the implemented algorithms, hash functions and more:
- **Hash Functions:** SHA3 (224, 256, 384 and 512 bits), SHA (224, 256, 384 and 512 bits) and MD5
- **Ciphers:** AES (128, 192 and 256 bits), RSA, Ed25519, DES and Triple-DES
